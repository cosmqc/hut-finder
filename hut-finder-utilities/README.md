# `hut-finder-utilities`

Contains all the required data to get things running, on the database side.

As of now, it just initialises hut data.

## How to run
```
cargo clean; cargo build; cargo run -- <flag>
```
`<flag>` can be one of:
- `hut`, to initialise hut data,
- and maybe more later on...

If you are looking for how to set up the database, refer to this [README](dbinit/README.md).
